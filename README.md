<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was built as the final project for Meta's Frontend Engineer certificate. I also went ahead and built way more functionalities than what was required to complete the certificate's courses!

### Features

- **Booking System**: Allows users to book a table at a specific restaurant location, choosing between different time slots and adding personalized notes.
- **Reservations Page**: Allows users to review all their reservations, with the possibility of deleting them.
- **Multiple Pages**: Uses React Router to navigate between different pages such as the main page, booking page, and reservations page.

### Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
