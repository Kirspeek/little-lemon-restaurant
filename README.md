This project was built as the final project for Meta's Frontend Engineer certificate.
It was my first time using React, yet it felt like home due to my experience in Salesforce Lightning. I even went ahead and built way more functionalities than what was required to complete the certificate's courses!




### Built With

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* JavaScript
